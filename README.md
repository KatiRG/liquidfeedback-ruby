Ruby port of [LiquidFeedback](http://liquidfeedback.org).

Very early stage, exploratory work in progress. Right now mostly interested in learning more about the platform and its concepts (like [liquid/delegative democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy)).

Also a good excuse to play with [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape).
